  Here is the experiment in the paper " Chen J, Deng Y, Huang Z. HDCat: Effectively Identifying Hot Data in Large-Scale I/O Streams
  with Enhanced Temporal Locality[C]//International Conference on Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing. Springer 
  International Publishing, 2015: 120-133. "ï¼ŒThe paper proposes and designs a hot data identification algorithm called HDCat by 
  leveraging the combination of a D-bit counter and a recency bit.Real traces are employed to evaluate HDCat against two state-of
  -the-art schemes including a multi-hash function method and a two-level LRU approach. Experimental results demonstrate that HDCat 
  can accurately capture the temporal locality of data access patterns and achieve a high hit ratio with low cache capacity and 
  runtime overhead.
